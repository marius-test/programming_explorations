# retro_programming

This folder is for experimenting and exploring some classic programming languages:  
**C++**, **Fortran**, and **Pascal**.

I write simple programs and scripts here to satisfy my curiosity and have fun exploring these languages.

Includes 3 folders with "Hello World" programs in C++, Fortran, and Pascal, compiled and ready to run.

Also contains a `tasks.json` configured for VSCode to compile any of the three by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + B** on Windows.
