# programming_explorations

This folder is for experimenting and exploring some classic programming languages:  
**C++**, **Fortran**, and **Pascal**.

I write simple programs and scripts here to satisfy my curiosity and have fun exploring these languages.

Includes 3 folders with "Hello World" programs in C++, Fortran, and Pascal, compiled and ready to run.

Also contains a `tasks.json` configured for VSCode to compile any of the three by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + B** on Windows.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Additionally, this repo now includes Jupyter notebooks for interactive Python experiments and scripting.  
These notebooks allow quick testing and exploration of Python code, combining code, output, and notes in a single document.

You can run these notebooks inside VSCode using the Jupyter extension, or with the classic Jupyter notebook server installed via `pip install jupyter`.
