# retro_sandbox

This folder is my playground for experimenting with some classic programming languages:  
**C++**, **Fortran**, and **Pascal**.

I write simple programs and scripts here to satisfy my curiosity and have fun exploring these languages.

Includes 3 folders with "Hello World" programs in C++, Fortran, and Pascalâ€”compiled and ready to run.

Also contains a `tasks.json` configured for VSCode to compile any of the three by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + B** on Windows.
