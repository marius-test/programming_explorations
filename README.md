# programming_explorations

This folder is for experimenting with various programming languages and tools, including:  
**C++**, **Fortran**, **Pascal**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Jupyter notebooks**.

Currently, each language folder contains a minimal "Hello!" program (or a basic Jupyter notebook) that is compiled and ready to run.  
This serves as a simple starting point for experimentation and exploration.

Also contains a `tasks.json` configured for VSCode to compile C++, Fortran, and Pascal programs by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + B** on Windows.
