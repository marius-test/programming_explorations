# programming_explorations

This folder is for experimenting with and exploring some classic programming languages:  
**C++**, **Fortran**, and **Pascal**.

I write simple programs and scripts here to satisfy my curiosity and have fun exploring these languages.

Includes 3 folders with "Hello!" programs in C++, Fortran, and Pascal, compiled and ready to run.

Also contains a `tasks.json` configured for VSCode to compile any of the three by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + B** on Windows.

## Jupyter

Additionally, this repo now includes Jupyter notebooks for interactive Python experiments and scripting.  
These notebooks allow quick testing and exploration of Python code, combining code, output, and notes in a single document.

You can run these notebooks inside VSCode using the Jupyter extension, or with the classic Jupyter notebook server installed via `pip install jupyter`.

## JavaScript

I am also experimenting with **JavaScript** in this repo.  
Here, I write and run simple Node.js scripts using VSCode and Node.js installed via nvm.

This allows me to explore modern JavaScript programming outside of the browser environment.

## Python

This repository may also contain small Python programs I build for experimentation.  
Projects that show potential will be published in their own repositories, each with a dedicated README.
